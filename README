This is a neat little script to collect churn data from git (or any VCS) and allow you visualize it in a treemap.

To collect basic churn data from git:
        git log --numstat | grep "^[0-9]" > git_churn 

You can also strip out whatever you don't want. For example, if we only wanted churn data for a Rails project's controllers:
        git log --numstat | grep "^[0-9]" | grep "app/controllers" > git_churn_controllers

Usage is easy.
        cat your_git_churn | ./git_churn_treemap.rb -commits > html/gitchurn.json

Then just open up the included treemap.html and BLAMMO! Treemaps...
